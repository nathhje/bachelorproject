## About
This is the source code of my bachelor project, which I am doing as the last project in my bachelor of Physics. To summarize: I'm studying the relationship between reflectance as a function of absorption coefficient and path length distribution. This relationship is an inverse Laplace transform. To perform this transformation, a
